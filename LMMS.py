So for the sake of argument, a minute song itself will be a total of 192 len/bar, 4 beats/bar, 120 beats/min
So 30 bars=30*192=5760 len per minute at 120bpm.
Alternatively it's bpm/numerator*192
Unless the denominator gets messed with, but that's something for another day.

However, if some semblance of structure is to be discovered, it must be split into bars.
0-4 bars intro, 4 or 8 bars for a section, 4 or 8 bars for a chorus, 0-4 bars bridge and 0-4 bars outro.
At minimum 2 sections and 1 chorus, adjusting tempo to suit the minute duration=12 bars.
At maximum 5 sections, 3 chorus and the bumpers, so 4I-8S-8C-8S-8C-8S-4B-8S-8C-8S-4O=72 bars. Tempo won't need adjustment.
Basically the song duration will be taken into account (bpm*beats(=192/4)=1 maybe) to check on the upper bound.
There is no lower bound (at least as duration is considered).

The number of sections depends on the chorus count and the existence of a bridge.
Though in reality it's not necessary to keep tabs on it as the structure will be important first.
Let's keep it fixed for now, only the bridge will severly alter the structure, so the intro/outro can be included regardless.
intro-section-chorus-section(-chorus-section)(-bridge-section)(-chorus-section)-outro
    There's a guaranteed 1 chorus, there may be a second, there may be a third after the bridge.
    There may be 1 chorus and a bridge, the bridge will be played and the section following but no chorus follows it.

- Calculate the number of bars played (could be stored in a dictionary, sections and choruses are composed only once)
- Find the value that involves both BPM and tempo
- Set the upper tempo limit

Hi it's me again.

The track container contains tracks
Every track consists of two parts, the instrument track data, and the patterns.
    There's only one instrumenttrack, but many patterns.

In this part, we only care about the contents of the patterns
These patterns can have names, which will be the keys of songDic/sectionLengths.
    (iterating over a dictionary causes the iterator to be the key)

Pattern tags will be created and appended in the dictionary. This will be repeated for every track.
